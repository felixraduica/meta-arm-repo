<p>This is a research project that aims to develop a prosthetic limb. The cost is kept low by using additive manufacturing. The output of the project will be open-source and easy to mix.</p>

## Timeline
<p>The project is expected to reach the prototyping phase at the end of 2023.</p>

## An incomplete list of considered requirements
<ul>
  <li>Strong and light-weight parts</li>
  <li>Focus on manufacturing and end-user</li>
  <li>Artificial intelligence integration</li>
  <li>Powered and manual grasping</li>
  <li>Development framework for future updates</li>
  <li>Stable and easy to use</li>
  <li>Always on status display</li>
  <li>Open source integration</li>
</ul>

## Meta-bionic Mission Statement
<p>We stand on the stage of introducing a baseline product. On which engineers, researchers and enthusiasts may contribute. An open framework like this allows for development with steady outcomes and results. Prosthetic open-source hardware and software design can lead to motivating results done through crowd source.</p>
<p>Meta-bionic seeks to enhance technology efforts through truly open source research. The power of community commits is greater than one researcher in one lab in a remote part of the world. Contribution of the many will lead to improvement and outcomes will be for the benefit of those in need.</p>
